## Cross Remote

This app combines your IR commands into a playlist that can be run with one click. Pauses can be set inbetween, as IR devices typically are not so fast. 

## Features
- Read out commands you recorded in the IR app
- Combine commands to a chain/playlist 
- Add pauses inbetween commands 
- Save your command chain / playlist to flipper
- Disable LED effects if not wanted

## In Development
- Ability to also add SubGhz commands 

## What good is this?

Example what you command chain (playlist) could do with one click
- Turn on your TV with the IR TV remote
- Turn on your Bluray player with the Blueray IR remote
- Turn on your surround sound with the speaker IR remote
- Turn on your ceiling fan using a subGhz remote
- Turn on your AC using another remote
