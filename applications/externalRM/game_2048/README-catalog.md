In this classic game, your objective is to collect the highest number of points by connecting identical numbers on the playing field.

You can control the game using the Up, Down, Right, and Left buttons, which allow you to move all cells on the playing field simultaneously.

Whenever you merge two identical numbers, their value doubles. For instance, combining 2 and 2 results in 4.

The game ends when no further moves are possible. Exiting the game will save the current state of the game board.
