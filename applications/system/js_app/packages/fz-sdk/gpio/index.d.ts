/**
 * Module for accessing the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) ports
 * 
 * ```js
 * let eventLoop = require("event_loop");
 * let gpio = require("gpio");
 * ```
 * 
 * This module depends on the `event_loop` module, so it _must_ only be imported
 * after `event_loop` is imported.
 * 
 * # Example
 * ```js
 * let eventLoop = require("event_loop");
 * let gpio = require("gpio");
 * 
 * let led = gpio.get("pc3");
 * led.init({ direction: "out", outMode: "push_pull" });
 * 
 * led.write(true);
 * delay(1000);
 * led.write(false);
 * delay(1000);
 * ```
