 * Things from this module are automatically available to you without having to
 * explicitly import anything.
 * 
 * # SDK versioning and features
 * 
 * ## Motivation
 * It is very important that you check that features are implemented before you
 * use them. By adding the necessary checks, you ensure that your users get a
 * clear warning instead of a cryptic error message when running the script.
 * 
 * This system has been designed in collaboration with our community in order to
 * make things better for everybody involved. You can find out more in this
 * discussion: https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/pull/3961
 * 
 * ## Community agreement
 * Each interpreter implementation (aka "JS SDK", aka "JS API"), including
 * those found in third-party firmware distributions, defines two markers for
 * signaling what it supports: the **SDK version** and the
 * **extra feature set**.
 * 
 * The **SDK version** consists of two semver-like integer components: the major
 * version and the minor version. Like semver, the major version is bumped when
 * a breaking change is introduced (i.e. one that would require correction of
 * apps by their developers), and the minor version is bumped when a new
 * non-breaking feature is introduced. Because we have adopted TypeScript,
 * the https://www.semver-ts.org/ standard is used to determine whether a change
 * is breaking or not. The basis of `semver-ts` is the "no new red squiggles"
 * rule.
 * 
 * Every major version is associated with a set of **extra features** that are
 * present in some firmware distributions but not others. Distributions may
 * cross-port features between each other, until at some point they get ported
 * into the upstream firmware distribution. With the next major release of the
 * JS SDK, all extra features present in the upstream distribution are now
 * declared **baseline features**, and thus no longer recognized as "extra
 * features".
 * 
 * Before using a feature, you must check that the interpreter that you're
 * running on actually supports it. If you don't, the portability of your
 * application will suffer.
 * 
 * ## Implementation
 * Use the following functions to check version compatibility:
 *   - `checkSdkCompatibility` when your script absolutely cannot function on an
 *     incompatible interpreter
 *   - `isSdkCompatible` when your script can leverage multiple interpreter
 *     editions to its advantage
 *   - `sdkCompatibilityStatus` when you need a detailed status on compatibility
 * 
 * Use the following functions to check feature compatibility:
 *   - `checkSdkFeatures` when your script absolutely cannot function on an
 *     incompatible interpreter
 *   - `doesSdkSupport` when your script can leverage multiple interpreter
 *     editions to its advantage
 * 
 * ## Automatic version enforcement
 * The SDK will automatically insert a call to `checkSdkCompatibility` in the
 * beginning of the resulting script. If you would like to disable this check
 * and instead use other manual compatibility checking facilities, edit your
 * `fz-sdk.config.json5`.
 * 
 * # Standard library
 * Standard library features are mostly unimplemented. This module defines,
 * among other things, the features that _are_ implemented.
