# Flipper Zero JavaScript SDK Wizard
This package contains an interactive wizard that lets you scaffold a JavaScript
application for Flipper Zero.

## Getting started
Create your application using the interactive wizard:
```shell
npx @flipperdevices/create-fz-app@latest
```

Then, enter the directory with your application and launch it:
