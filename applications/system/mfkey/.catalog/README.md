# Flipper Zero MFKey

This application allows you to calculate the keys of MIFARE Classic cards using the Mfkey32 and Nested algorithms directly on your Flipper Zero. After collecting the nonces using the Extract MF Keys feature of the NFC app, they can be used to calculate the keys to the card in the MFKey app.

## Usage

After collecting nonces using the Extract MF Keys option, press the Start button in the MFKey app and wait for it to finish. The calculation can take more than 10 minutes, so you'll have to be patient. After the calculation is complete, the keys will be saved to the user key dictionary.
