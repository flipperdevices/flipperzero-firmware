# unavailable while SRST is asserted, and that is used to access the DBGMCU
# component at 0x5C001000 in the examine-end event handler.
#
# It is possible to access the DBGMCU component at 0xE00E1000 via AP2 instead
# of the default AP0, and that works with SRST asserted; however, nonzero AP
# usage does not work with HLA, so is not done by default. That change could be
# made in a local configuration file if connect_assert_srst mode is needed for
# a specific application and a non-HLA adapter is in use.
