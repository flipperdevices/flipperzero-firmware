## Cross Remote

This app combines your IR and SubGhz commands into a playlist that can be run with one click. Pauses can be set inbetween, as IR/SubGhz devices typically are not so fast. 

## Features
- Read out commands you recorded in the IR app
- Read out commands you saved as .sub files
- Combine commands to a chain/playlist 
- Add pauses inbetween commands 
- Save your command chain / playlist to flipper
- Disable LED effects if not wanted
- Configure duration of IR Signals

## What good is this?
