# FindMyFlipper
The FindMy Flipper app turns your FlipperZero into an effective tracking device, compatible with both Apple AirTag and Samsung SmartTag. It uses the BLE beacon to broadcast, allowing users to clone existing tags, generate OpenHaystack key pairs for Apple's FindMy network, and customize beacon intervals and transmit power.
