# Flipboard

<img src="./flipkeyboard/gallery/banner.png">

The FlipBoard v1.1 is a versatile device for the Flipper Zero that can enable all kinds of features. It has 4 buttons that connect via separate GPIO pins, so you can react to any combinations of button up/down events. Each button has a 24-bit color LED that is programmable using the WS2812b protocol. There is also a small single-color LED on the board you can use, for example, to signal a status change.

There are a couple of applications, such as flipkeyboard (a musical keyboard) and flipblinky (visual effects), that demonstrate some of the features. We will be adding more applications as time progresses, along with tutorials on how to write your own applications. Please let us know your feedback.

You can order your FlipBoard from [https://tindie.com/stores/MakeItHackin](https://tindie.com/stores/MakeItHackin).
