# Leed's Flipper Zero Applications

 <div style="text-align:center"><img src="Misc/ledpulser/assets/flipper_logo_orange.png"/></div>

## Apps removed from this Repo
I reduced this Repo to the more basic apps I made for testing. Previously included Apps now have their own repository
- [Cross Remote](https://github.com/leedave/flipper-zero-cross-remote)
- [Color Guess](https://github.com/leedave/flipper-zero-color-guess)

## Misc (Stuff I did to learn from)
- Orgamotron: Added new vibro modes to the app orginally developed by qqmajikpp<br>
- Ledpulser: Runs pulse animations on the LED light<br>

## How to install on Flipper Zero
- If you do not have one, download a firmware<br>
- Plug your Flipper Zero in via USB. <br>
- Copy the contents of the application folder into the applications_user folder of your firmware. <br> 

Then run the command: 
 ```
.\fbt launch_app APPSRC=applications_user/<application name>
 ```
The application will be compiled and copied onto your device.
