## Step 1. Install the micro Flipper Build Tool

 is a cross-platform tool developed and supported by our team that enables basic development tasks for Flipper Zero, such as building and debugging applications, flashing firmware, creating VS Code development configurations, and flashing firmware to the Wi-Fi Developer Board.

Run the following command in the Terminal:

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade ufbt
```

**On Windows:**

1. Download the latest version of Python on 
2. Run the following command in the PowerShell

```

To fix it, try doing the following:

- Disconnect the Developer Board from your computer, then reconnect it. After that, switch your Developer Board to Bootloader mode once again, as described in 

- Use a different USB port on your computer.

- Use a different USB-C cable.
