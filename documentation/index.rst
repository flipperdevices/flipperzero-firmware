This documentation is intended for developers who want to modify the firmware of the Flipper Zero. If you are looking for the user manual, please visit `the User Documentation <https://docs.flipperzero.one/>`_.

The documentation is divided into several sections, with all of them accessible from the sidebar on the left. 

Apart from the manually-written documentation files, there's also an auto-generated documentation section, which contains the reference to the structures and APIs of the firmware. It is generated from the source code, and are useful for quickly finding the source code or API documentation for a particular function or data structure.
