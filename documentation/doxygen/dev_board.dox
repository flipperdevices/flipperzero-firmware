Wi-Fi-enabled Developer Board brings debugging and firmware update capabilities to your Flipper Zero. The Developer Board is based on the ESP32-S2 MCU with custom firmware incorporating Black Magic Debug and CMSIS-DAP, and is built with ESP-IDF. It can flash and debug various microprocessors and microcontrollers (including the one used in your Flipper Zero) via Wi-Fi or USB cable.

The Developer Board provides a debug interface, allowing developers to halt program execution, set breakpoints, inspect variables and memory, and step through code execution.
