# Contributing

Our main goal is to build a healthy and sustainable community around Flipper, so we're open to any new ideas and contributions. We also have some rules and taboos here, so please read this page and our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) carefully.

## I need help

The best place to search for answers is our [User Documentation](https://docs.flipper.net). If you can't find the answer there, check our [Discord Server](https://flipp.dev/discord) or our [Forum](https://forum.flipperzero.one/). If you want to contribute to the firmware development or modify it for your own needs, you can also check our [Developer Documentation](https://developer.flipper.net/flipperzero/doxygen).

## I want to report an issue

If you've found an issue and want to report it, please check our [Issues](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/issues) page. Make sure the description contains information about the firmware version you're using, your platform, and a clear explanation of the steps to reproduce the issue.

## I want to contribute code

Before opening a PR, please confirm that your changes must be contained in the firmware. Many ideas can easily be implemented as external applications and published in the [Flipper Application Catalog](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipper-application-catalog). If you are unsure, reach out to us on the [Discord Server](https://flipp.dev/discord) or the [Issues](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/issues) page, and we'll help you find the right place for your code.

Also, please read our [Contribution Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [Coding Style](/CODING_STYLE.md), and make sure your code is compatible with our [Project License](/LICENSE).

Finally, open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/pulls) and make sure that CI/CD statuses are all green.

# Development

Flipper Zero Firmware is written in C, with some bits and pieces written in C++ and armv7m assembly languages. An intermediate level of C knowledge is recommended for comfortable programming. C, C++, and armv7m assembly languages are supported for Flipper applications.

# Firmware RoadMap

[Firmware RoadMap Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO_3D6xU=/)

## Requirements

Supported development platforms:

- Windows 10+ with PowerShell and Git (x86_64)
- macOS 12+ with Command Line tools (x86_64, arm64)
- Ubuntu 20.04+ with build-essential and Git (x86_64)

Supported in-circuit debuggers (optional but highly recommended):

- [Flipper Zero Wi-Fi Development Board](https://shop.flipperzero.one/products/wifi-devboard)
- CMSIS-DAP compatible: Raspberry Pi Debug Probe and etc...
- ST-Link (v2, v3, v3mods)
- J-Link

Flipper Build System will take care of all the other dependencies.

## Cloning source code

Make sure you have enough space and clone the source code:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware.git
```

## Building

Build firmware using Flipper Build Tool:

```shell
./fbt
```

## Flashing firmware using an in-circuit debugger

Connect your in-circuit debugger to your Flipper and flash firmware using Flipper Build Tool:

```shell
./fbt flash
```

## Flashing firmware using USB

Make sure your Flipper is on, and your firmware is functioning. Connect your Flipper with a USB cable and flash firmware using Flipper Build Tool:

```shell
./fbt flash_usb
```
