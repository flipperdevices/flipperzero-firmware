This firmware is a fork of <a href='https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware/'>Unleashed</a> and the main Flipper Devices FW! We are NOT paywalled. I will try to keep active development and updates from both in this build along with any other projects that can be found to be useful to the community.
