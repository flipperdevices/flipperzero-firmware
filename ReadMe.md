#### Thank you to all the supporters; this firmware is a fork of [Unleashed/xMasterX](https://github.com/Eng1n33r/flipperzero-firmware) & the main Flipper Devices FW! I will try to keep active development and updates from both in this build along with any other projects that can be found to be useful to the community. I try to keep this FW build the most cutting edge with updates from both and updates from active community projects. All features and projects pulled are listed in expandable sections below. Please do [support us](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins/blob/420/SUPPORT.md) and/or [xMasterX](https://github.com/Eng1n33r/flipperzero-firmware)! Everyone gives much of their uncompensated free time to ensure the success of the Flipper Zero!

- To install new FW, extract the [latest release zip file](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins/releases) to a folder, put the folder in the update folder on your SD card, and run the update file inside the folder using the Archive app (down from flipper desktop). If you were previously unleashed, you need to update your extend_range.txt file. **UPDATE IGNORE FLAG TO TRUE TO UNLEASH YOUR FLIPPER!!** On any update, you may need to update this file and your unirf map file, so keep backups. 😄
